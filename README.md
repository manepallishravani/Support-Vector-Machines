# Support-Vector-Machines

Support Vector Machine‚Äù (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. Here we will consider a discriminative classification: rather than modeling each class, we simply find a line or curve (in two dimensions) or manifold (in multiple dimensions) that divides the classes from each other.As an example of this, consider the simple case of a classification task, in which the two classes of points are well separated.
